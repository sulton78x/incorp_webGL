          image="/assets/Ugo Cacciatori.jpg"
          details="Born under the massive Alps of Carrara, Ugo Cacciatori belongs to a dynasty of marble quarry owners and artists. His early passion for materials and shapes together with his innate creative skills led him to study Architecture at the University of Florence. Ugo then moved to London where, after a first involvement in architectural firms, he decided to challenge himself in the fashion industry. At the end of the Nineties Ugo’s first jewelry collection was presented in Milan at the same time he started consultancy work for Valentino, Giambattista Valli, Romeo Gigli, Marni, Fendi and several others. The desire of a hidden place to create brought him to Lerici, a little fisherman village on the border between Tuscany and Liguria with a landscape that inspired the likes of Lord Byron and Percy Bysshi Shelley. This shifted Ugo’s energy, focusing on fewer projects and collaborations, such as the creative direction of Santa Croce, a brand of the Prada Group, and the development of a jewelry line for Diesel Black Gold, sharing time between Milan and New York for over a decade. He recently added Los Angeles as a creative base where to express his experience while enjoying the Californian lifestyle."
